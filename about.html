                                I graduated in the Spring of 2022 from the University of Montana. While I did graduate with a
                                degree in psychology, I took a few courses in Computer Science as well as a Media Arts course
                                for Web Design. I really enjoyed these classes because they provided different challenges and 
                                once you got through those challenges the sense of accomplishement that you feel is one of the
                                best feelings. It's like making a birdie putt on the golf course!

                                Along with my degree I was apart of the University's Women's Griz Golf Team. Throughout my time
                                as a student-athlete I learned many skills that translate into the professional world. The biggest 
                                skill I learned was how important time-management was. Between the early morning wake ups for workouts,
                                a full day of school, and then golf practice I got really good at managing school, golf, and the social
                                aspects of college. Once I graduated college I knew I wanted to start back up and become a developer.

                                I did my research and looked into the coding bootcamps. In my search I found one called Nucamp, it had 
                                really good reviews and it had a program where I could get into backend devloping. From October of 2022 
                                to January of 2023 I went through the program and graduated with an honors certificate. I learned a lot 
                                and started to really get excited about development. Seeing my project ideas come to life and creating 
                                functionality was the most satisfying feeling for me. I am currently gaining more knowledge and 
                                experience as an intern in web development.
